# Two Sum Codebase

This repository contains a TypeScript implementation of the "Two Sum" problem, a common algorithmic challenge. The goal is to find two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target and return their indices.

## Structure

- **Source Code**: The main logic is implemented in `twoSum.ts`.
- **Tests**: Comprehensive test cases are provided in `twoSum.test.ts` to ensure the correctness of the solution.
- **Configuration**: TypeScript and Jest configurations are set up to facilitate development and testing.

## Key Files

- `twoSum.ts`: Contains the implementation of the `twoSum` function.
- `twoSum.test.ts`: Includes various test cases to validate the `twoSum` function.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration file.
- `jest.config.js`: Configuration for running tests with Jest.
- `eslint.config.js`: ESLint configuration for code quality and style enforcement.

## Usage

To use the `twoSum` function, import it into your TypeScript file and call it with an array of numbers and a target sum. The function will return the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.

## Testing

Run the tests using Jest to ensure the implementation works as expected. The test suite covers various scenarios, including edge cases and error handling.

## Development

Ensure you have Node.js and TypeScript installed. Use the provided configurations to maintain code quality and consistency.
