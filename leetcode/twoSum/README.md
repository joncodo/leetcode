Problem: Two Sum
Description: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target. Assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you cannot use the same element twice.

Example:

plaintext
Copy code
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
